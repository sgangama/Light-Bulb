Someone who doesnt live near a constituency that he/she is elligible to vote in might not know a great deal about the people that are contesting elections there. So a online decision helper that can demarcate the merits from the demerits of all the candidates so that the people living far-off can get a clearer picture of the whole situation will be quite desirable. Again there is the added problem of people not always being able to access the constituencies where-in they are registered if they dont live near it, hence a secure platform for voting online has a great chance to ease out the stress of these people. Moreover the online platform has a greater chance of giving out spontaneous results immediately after the poll ends thus saving the cost of man-power as well as the expensive EVMs and poll booths across the country thus minimizing the risks such as booth capturing especially in a third world country like India. Hence azure blockchain could be implemented to solve the combined problem of ignorance, accessibility, feasibility as well as voter safety.
